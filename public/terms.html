            the
            Terms of Service without telling you beforehand in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>to reflect changes in laws and regulatory requirements which apply to Bitfan and the services,
                features
                and programs of Bitfan where such changes require Bitfan to change its terms and conditions in a
                manner
                which does not allow us to give reasonable notice to you; and</li>
            <li>to address an unforeseen and imminent danger related to defending Bitfan, Fans or Creators from fraud,
                malware, spam, data breaches or other cybersecurity risks.</li>
            <li><strong>We may make changes to or suspend or withdraw Bitfan:</strong> We may update and change
                Bitfan
                from time to time for any reason, including to reflect changes to our services, Users' needs and our
                business practices or to improve performance, enhance functionality or address security issues. We will
                try
                to give you reasonable notice of any major changes. We do not guarantee that Bitfan, or any Content on
                it,
                will always be available or accessible without interruption. We may suspend or withdraw or restrict the
                availability of all or any part of Bitfan for business or operational reasons. We will try to give you

                end of each session, and to be particularly careful when accessing your account from a public or shared
                computer so that others are not able to access, view or record your password or other personal

                applicable law.</li>
            <li>It is our policy to suspend access to any Content you post on Bitfan which we become aware may not
                comply
                with the Terms of Service (including, in particular, our <a href="#acceptable-use-policy">Acceptable Use
                    Policy</a>) and/or any

                relevant Content by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@bitfan.com">support@bitfan.com</a>.
                Following our investigation of the suspected non-compliance or unlawfulness of the relevant Content, we

                take any action we consider appropriate, including to reinstate access to the Content or to permanently
                remove or disable access to the relevant Content without needing to obtain any consent from you and

                assistance (including by providing us with copies of any information which we request) in our

                We will not be responsible for any loss suffered by you arising from the suspension of access to your
                Content or any other steps which we take in good faith to investigate any suspected non-compliance or
                unlawfulness of your Content under this section.</li>
            <li>If we suspend access to or delete any of your Content, we will notify you via email or electronic

                your Bitfan account, but we are not obligated to give you prior notice of such removal or suspension.

                Terms of Service in a way which has or could have serious consequences for us or another User; or</li>
            <li>if you take any action that in our opinion has caused or is reasonably likely to cause us to suffer a

                under
                any obligation to do so, we may at any time submit or withdraw any such notification to any third-party
                website or service where we consider it appropriate to do so. However, we do not and are under no

        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Subscriptions and purchases by Fans:</strong> This section describes the
            terms
            which apply to Fan/Creator Transactions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>All Fan/Creator Transactions are contracts between Fans and Creators on the terms of the <a
                    href="https://Bitfan.com/contract">Standard Contract between Fan and Creator</a>. Although we
                facilitate Fan/Creator Transactions by providing the Bitfan platform and storing Content we are not a
                party to the <a href="https://Bitfan.com/contract">Standard Contract between Fan and Creator</a> or
                any
                other contract which may exist between a Fan and Creator, and are not responsible for any Fan/Creator
                Transactions.</li>
            <li>Creators are solely responsible for determining (within the parameters for pricing on Bitfan) the
                pricing
                applicable to Fan/Creator Transactions and the Content to which you may be given access. All prices
                appear
                in USD only.</li>
            <li>Fan Payments are exclusive of VAT, which shall be added at the current rate as applicable to Fan
                Payments.
            </li>
            <li>To be able to enter into a Fan/Creator Transaction with a particular Creator, you must first add a
                payment
                card to your account and then click the 'Subscribe' button on the relevant Creator's profile.</li>
            <li>You authorize us and our subsidiary companies to supply your payment card details to a third-party
                payment
                provider for the purpose of processing your Fan Payment. All Fan Payments will be charged in USD. Your
                payment card provider may charge you currency conversion fees. We do not have control over currency
                exchange
                rates or charges imposed by your payment card provider or bank and we and our subsidiary companies will
                not
                be responsible for paying any charges or fees imposed by your payment card provider or bank.</li>
            <li>If you choose to provide details of two or more payment cards, then if you try to make a Fan Payment
                from
                the first card and the card is rejected for any reason, then the other payment card will be used to
                collect
                the full Fan Payment.</li>
            <li>The payment provider will take (i) periodic payments from your payment card for Fan Payments which are
                Subscriptions; and (ii) immediate payments from your payment card for Fan Payments other than
                Subscriptions
                (including any tips paid by you to a Creator). You authorize and consent to each of these payments being
                debited using your supplied payment card details.</li>
            <li>Apart from free-trial Subscriptions, all Subscriptions to a Creator's profile will automatically renew
                at
                the end of the relevant subscription period, except if your payment card is declined, the subscription
                price
                for the Subscription has increased, or you have turned off the "Auto-Renew" switch located on the
                relevant
                Creator's profile. This means that if you want to stop subscribing to a Creator's profile and paying
                continuing monthly subscription charges, you will need to turn off the "Auto-Renew" switch located on
                the
                relevant Creator's profile.</li>
            <li>If you cancel a Subscription you will continue to be permitted to view the relevant Creator's Content
                until
                the end of the subscription period in which you cancelled, after which no further payments will be taken
                from your payment card in respect of subscriptions to that Creator's profile (unless you choose to pay
                for a
                new Subscription to that Creator’s profile), and you will no longer be able to view the relevant
                Creator's
                Content.</li>
            <li>You agree that you will not make unjustified requests for a refund in respect of any Fan/Creator
                Transaction
                or tip to a Creator, or unjustified chargeback requests of your payment card provider in relation to any
                Fan/Creator Transaction or tip to a Creator. If we consider that any request for a refund or chargeback
                request was made by you in bad faith, we have the right to suspend or delete your User account.</li>
            <li>Wallet credits: You can prepay an amount on Bitfan (known as "Wallet Credits") which you can later use
                to
                make Fan Payments. Purchases on Bitfan cannot be divided - if you attempt a purchase that costs more
                than
                the total amount of your remaining Wallet Credits, your payment card will be charged the full amount for
                that purchase. Wallet Credits are subject to a maximum amount as determined by us from time to time.
                Interest will not accrue on Wallet Credits. Wallet Credits are non-refundable, which means that you are
                not
                entitled to a refund of any unused Wallet Credits.</li>
            <li><strong>Suspension of your User account:</strong> If we suspend your User account in accordance with our
                rights under the Terms of Service, then any Fan Payments which would otherwise have fallen due during
                the
                period of suspension of your User account will be suspended during the period of the suspension of your
                User
                account.<br><br data-cke-filler="true"></li>

            <li>If you have chosen the Stripe Payout Option, Stripe will collect the Fan Payment and pay the Creator
                Earnings to your bank account.</li>
            <li>Where Stripe is not the Payout Option chosen by you, Our Fee will be deducted from the Fan Payment
                received
                and your Creator Earnings will be held by us or one of our subsidiary companies on your behalf.</li>
            <li>Your Bitfan account will be updated within a reasonable time with your Creator Earnings. Your Creator
                Earnings will become available for withdrawal by you from your Bitfan account once such Creator
                Earnings
                appear in your Bitfan account.</li>
            <li>To make a withdrawal of Creator Earnings from your Bitfan account, you must have at least the minimum
                payout amount in your Bitfan account. Please click on the Banking page on your account to see what the
                minimum payout amount is for your country of residence and Payout Option.</li>
            <li>The amount that you see in your ‘current balance’ in your Bitfan account is your Creator Earnings at
                the
                relevant time. All Fan Payments and Creator Earnings are transacted in USD only. If you have chosen the
                "Stripe" Payout Option then the Fan Payments and Creator Earnings figures will be reflected in your
                local
                currency, at an exchange rate controlled by Stripe. Your bank may charge you currency conversion or
                transfer
                fees to receive the money. Additionally, your e-wallet company may charge you a fee for accessing the
                money.
                We do not have control over currency exchange rates or charges imposed by your bank or your e-wallet
                company, and we and our subsidiary companies will not be responsible for paying any charges imposed by
                your
                bank or your e-wallet company.</li>
            <li>If a Fan successfully seeks a refund or chargeback from their credit card provider in respect of a Fan
                Payment made to you, we may investigate and may decide to deduct from your account an amount equal to
                the
                Creator Earnings earned by you on the charged-back or refunded amount.</li>
            <li>Except for Payout Options involving payment by direct bank transfer, we do not store any data disclosed
                by
                you when you register your Payout Options with a third-party payment provider.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Circumstances in which we may withhold Creator Earnings:</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">We may withhold all or any part of the Creator Earnings due to you but not yet paid
            out:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>if we think that you have or may have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service;
            </li>
            <li>if you attempt or threaten to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which we think has or
                could
                have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or
                another
                User); or</li>
            <li>if we suspect that all or any part of the Creator Earnings result from unlawful or fraudulent activity,
                either by you or by the Fan who made the Fan Payment resulting in the Creator Earnings,</li>
            <li>We may also withhold all or any part of the Creator Earnings due to you but not yet paid out if we
                receive
                notice that you have secured, encumbered, pledged, assigned, or otherwise allowed a lien to be placed on
                Creator Earnings. We undertake no duty to pay Creator Earnings to third-party lienholders and may
                withhold
                payment of Creator Earnings until the lien has been removed.</li>
            <li>We shall not have any responsibility to you if we withhold or forfeit any of your Creator Earnings where
                we
                have a right to do so under these Terms of Use for Creators.</li>
            <li>If we are withholding all or any part of the Creator Earnings due to you and we determine that part of
                the
                Creator Earnings withheld by us is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected
                unlawful or fraudulent activity, then we may arrange for you to be paid the part of the Creator Earnings
                which we determine to be unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful or
                fraudulent activity. However, you agree that if we consider that your breach(es) of the Terms of Service
                has
                or may cause us loss, we may withhold all Creator Earnings due to you but not yet paid and we may set
                off
                such amounts against any losses suffered by us.</li>

        <ol>
            <li>For the purposes of UK VAT only, Creators are treated as providing their services to Bitfan, rather

        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">If you are a Creator registered for UK VAT:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You will be treated, for VAT purposes, as charging Bitfan your Creator Earnings (80% of all and any

                Payments), together with UK VAT at the prevailing rate in force at the time of the Fan Payment;</li>
            <li>Bitfan also agrees that, subject to the terms set out in this section of these Terms of Use for
                Creators,
                you can add UK VAT at the prevailing rate in force at the time of the referral payment to the amount of

            that you must have submitted to us copies of the following before payment of the VAT Amount will be made to

            <li>You agree that you will keep copies of all VAT invoices and VAT returns in connection with your earnings
                from Bitfan and you will provide us with copies of such documents within 14 days of our written
                request
                that you do so. For the avoidance of doubt, it is your obligation to comply with all provisions of VAT
                legislation and make, give, obtain, maintain and keep accurate, complete and up-to-date records,
                invoices,
                accounts and other documents required for the purposes of the VAT legislation.</li>
            <li>If you are a Creator in the UK who is not required to register for UK VAT, then you should monitor the
                level
                of taxable sales that you make in the UK (including any Referral Payments) to ensure you have not
                exceeded
                the VAT registration threshold in the UK. It is your obligation, as a taxable person, to monitor whether
                you
                have exceeded the VAT registration threshold.</li>
            <li>We do not monitor earnings that Creators receive from other income sources. However, we will monitor the
                annual earnings of UK Creators on our platform, and if you are not already VAT registered and your
                earnings
                exceed the VAT registration threshold, you will receive a notification from us asking you to register
                for
                VAT. If you receive such a VAT registration notification, you agree to register for VAT as soon as
                possible
                and to send your VAT registration number to us at <a href="mailto:vat@bitfan.com">vat@bitfan.com</a>,
                within 6 weeks of such notification. Failure to do so may result in your Bitfan account being closed.

                Referral Program, we are legally required to inform you that if you sign this contract, you have 14 days
                in

        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> These Referral Program Terms are additional terms which apply if you use
                the
                Bitfan Referral Program. These Referral Program Terms form part of your agreement with us.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Interpretation:</strong> In these Referral Program Terms defined terms have
            the
            same meanings given to them in the <a href="#terms-use-all-users">Terms of
                Use
                for all Users</a>. In addition:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>"<strong>Referring User</strong>" is also referred to as "<strong>you</strong>" or
                "<strong>your</strong>"
                in these Referral Program Terms;</li>
            <li>"<strong>Referred Creator</strong>" means the person who joins Bitfan as a Creator via the Referring
                User's unique referral link.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>What is the Bitfan Referral Program?</strong> Bitfan offers a referral
            program by which existing Users can introduce people who are interested in becoming Creators to Bitfan and
            receive referral payments from Bitfan which are calculated and limited as described in these Referral
            Program
            Terms.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>The rules of the Bitfan Referral Program:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Only Users of Bitfan with a current User account can participate in the Bitfan Referral Program. If
                a
                User's account has been suspended or terminated by us for any reason or deleted by the User, that User
                will
                not be eligible to participate in the Bitfan Referral Program.</li>
            <li>You will need on your User account page to add a bank account or a payment method details of your bank
                account or a payment method in order to receive referral payments under the Bitfan Referral Program.
            </li>
            <li>Each User has a unique referral link (which can be accessed via the User's User account) which the User
                may
                share with others. When sharing your unique referral link you must not impersonate Bitfan or give the
                impression that your referral link is being shared or promoted by us. You must not use Google Ads or any
                similar advertising platform or search engine advertising service to share or promote your unique
                referral
                link. Upon our request, you must disclose the methods by which you share your unique referral link in
                the
                Bio/Website field of your Bitfan account.</li>
            <li>The Referred Creator must click on your unique referral link and then register with Bitfan using the
                same
                browser that they used to click on your unique referral link. If someone registers with Bitfan other
                than
                by using your unique referral link, we will not link that account to your referral and no referral
                payments
                will be made to you.</li>
            <li>The Referred Creator must not have opened a User account with Bitfan (whether under the same name or
                another name) before clicking on your unique referral link. If the Referred Creator is currently or has
                previously been a User of Bitfan no referral payments will be made to you for the referral.</li>
            <li>If the Referred Creator sets up more than one User account referral payments will be made to you on the
                earnings made by the Referred Creator from their first User account only. No referral payments will be
                made
                to you on any further User accounts set up by the Referred Creator.</li>
            <li>No referral payments will be made to you on any referral of a Referred Creator which we determine is
                owned
                or operated by you, or is in a commercial relationship with you. You will provide any information which
                we
                request to enable us to determine whether the Referred Creator is owned or operated by you or if there
                is a
                commercial relationship between you and the Referred Creator.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">You agree that when promoting Bitfan in any way as a Referring User:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>you will not give a false impression of Bitfan, the services, programs, and content (including
                Content)
                made available through Bitfan, its Users or the Terms of Service; and</li>
            <li>you will not make any statements which suggest to a potential Creator that the potential Creator will
                make a
                particular sum of money (or any money) from their use of Bitfan, or any statements regarding the
                likely
                number of Fans.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Referral payments:</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>How are referral payments calculated?</strong> Once a Referred Creator has
            become a registered User of Bitfan in accordance with the rules of the Bitfan Referral Program described
            above, the Referring User will be paid a referral payment equal to five per cent (5%) of Fan Payments
            generated
            by the Referred Creator in the twelve months after the date on which the Referred Creator becomes a
            registered
            User of Bitfan, up to a maximum referral payment by Bitfan to the Referring User of US$50,000 per
            Referred
            Creator.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">This means that if a Referred Creator generates Fan Payments with a total value of
            US$1
            million or more in the twelve months after the date on which that Referred Creator becomes a registered User
            of
            Bitfan, then the Referring User's referral payments in relation to that Referred Creator will be capped at
            US$50,000 in total. However, if the Referred Creator generates Fan Payments with a total value of less than
            US$1
            million in the twelve months after the date on which that Referred Creator becomes a registered User of
            Bitfan, then the Referring User will be paid five per cent (5%) of the Fan Payments generated by that
            Referred
            Creator in the twelve months after the date on which the Referred Creator becomes a registered User of
            Bitfan,
            following which no further referral payments will be made to the Referring User in respect of that Referred
            Creator.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">For all referrals made prior to 1 May 2020, referral payments will be made to the
            relevant Referring Users until 1 May 2021 or until US$50,000 has been paid out to the Referring User on the
            referral, whichever occurs first.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>VAT:</strong> If you are a Referring User you should know that all referral payments payable to
                you
                by us will be inclusive of any VAT (as defined in the <a href="#terms-use-creators">Terms of Use for
                    Creators</a>) which is or
                becomes chargeable on any supplies made by you, except as provided for in the " <a
                    href="#promoting-tax-compliance-vat">Promoting Tax compliance and
                    VAT</a>" section of the <a href="#terms-use-creators">Terms of Use
                    for
                    Creators</a>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Warning:</strong> In compliance with regulation 3 of the Trading Scheme
            Regulations 1997 (as amended) and section 120(1) of the Fair Trading Act 1973, please read the warning below
            in
            respect of the Bitfan Referral Program:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is illegal for us or for a participant in the Bitfan Referral Program (including Referring Users
                and
                Referred Creators) to persuade anyone to make a payment by promising benefits from getting others to
                join
                the Bitfan Referral Program.</li>
            <li>Do not be misled by claims that high earnings are easily achieved from participation in the Bitfan
                Referral Program.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Choosing a payout method to receive referral payments:</strong> In order to be able to receive
                referral payments you must first choose one of the payout methods provided by Bitfan in your country
                of
                residence. These methods are called "Payout Options".</li>
            <li><strong>How frequently are referral payments made?</strong> The referral payment due to you on Fan
                Payments
                made to the Referred Creator in a calendar month will be transferred to you on or around the first day
                of
                the next calendar month (which means, for example, that referral payments due to you in respect of Fan
                Payments made to the Referred Creator in February shall be paid to you on or around 1 March).</li>
            <li><strong>Who bears the cost of the referral payment?</strong> The cost of the referral payment is borne
                by
                us, not the Referred Creator.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Our rights relating to the referral program.</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>If referral payments have been made incorrectly then we have the right to recover the wrongly paid sums
                from
                the User to whom the wrongly paid sums have been paid.</li>
            <li>We may request you or Referred Creators (or both) to provide us with ID and other information reasonably
                required by us to verify any referral payment to be made and the person to whom any referral payment
                should
                be made. Failure to provide any information requested by us may lead to you losing your entitlement to
                referral payments in respect of the relevant Referred Creator.</li>
            <li>We may change any aspect of the Bitfan Referral Program (including how referral payments are
                calculated)
                or discontinue the Bitfan Referral Program at any time, but no change will deprive any Referring User
                of
                referral payments already earned based on Fan Payments made to Referred Creators before the changes came
                into effect.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>Circumstances in which we may withhold referral payments:</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left:0px;">We may withhold all or any part of the referral payments due to you but not yet paid
            out:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>if we think that you have or may have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service;
            </li>
            <li>if you attempt or threaten to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has or could have
                serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or another
                User); or</li>
            <li>if we suspect that all or any part of the referral payments due to you result from unlawful or
                fraudulent
                activity, either by you, by the Fan who made the Fan Payment to the Referred Creator which resulted in
                the
                referral payment, or by the Referred Creator to whom the Fan Payment was made which resulted in the
                referral
                payment,</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>We may also withhold all or any part of the referral payments due to you but not yet paid out if we
                receive
                notice that you have secured, encumbered, pledged, assigned, or otherwise allowed a lien to be placed
                on,
                referral payments. We undertake no duty to pay referral payments to third-party lienholders and may
                withhold
                payment of Creator Earnings until the lien has been removed.</li>
            <li>We shall not have any responsibility to you if we withhold or forfeit any payment due to you under the
                Bitfan Referral Program where we have a right to do so under these Referral Program Terms.</li>
            <li>If we are withholding all or any part of the referral payments due to you and we determine that part of
                the
                referral payments withheld by us is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected
                unlawful or fraudulent activity, then we may arrange for you to be paid the part of the referral
                payments
                which is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful or fraudulent
                activity.
                However, you agree that if we consider that your breach(es) of the Terms of Service has or may cause us
                loss, we may withhold all referral payments due to you but not yet paid and we may set off such amounts
                against any losses suffered by us.</li>
